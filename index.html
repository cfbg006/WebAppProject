        <h2 class="section-title">Hi, I'm Clivilles!</h2>
        <p>
            My name can be said as Kli-vels. I am a cybersecurity bootcamper at the University of Toronto - SCS.
            I work full time as a retail assistant manager. 
            I would love to travel the world (be a tech-nomad). My favourite destination thus far is New Zealand.

                <h3>What is a Cybersecurity Bootcamp?</h3>
                <h4>Cybersecurity Bootcamp</h4>
                <p>Simply put it is a condensed, fast-paced program that mostly focuses on hands-on learning. The program highlights practical challenges and projects that help enhance real-life problem solving skills. Theoretical concepts are delivered but in a need-to-know manner. <br>   <br> The program is designed for individuals who are looking to pivot their careers into the tech world, as well as IT professionals who are looking to upskill. <br> As the program is an accelerated curriculum, the UofT-SCS Cybersecurity Bootcamp provides simulation laboratories for practical exercises, weekly tutoring, career workshops, and career services (such as Career Engagement Network, Career Events, Coaching and Advising) to support students throughout the program and post-graduation.
